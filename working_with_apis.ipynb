    "APIs are important because they allow for ease of communication between applications. If your application needs to interact with another application than an API helps to define the rules of this interaction. Each API will have its own nuances but generally you request information from an API by passing in parameters via a URL. Interacting with an API is a much easier way to grab dating than trying to scrub HTML."

You can also mock up API requests and responses which is helpful during development and unit testing: https://realpython.com/blog/python/testing-third-party-apis-with-mocks/.\n",
