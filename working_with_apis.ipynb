I do most of my work in linux (Ubuntu 14.04) and run Python 3.5. Most of my code development is done via text editor (Sublime), command line and IPython. If I need to share or demo code then I use Jupyter but I don't use it much when I'm actually developing because it feels a bit clunky."

We are also going to have to import some packages to help us make the request and parse out the information that is returned."

For example in our API call we might want to access the API response, the json, the dataframe and all the parameters that we passed to make a request. In a class we can create attributes to easily get these attributes without have to call a bunch of linked functions."
